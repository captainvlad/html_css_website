In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN,
proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use
and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an
Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote
the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and
CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request
for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN.

In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hyper-
text is used" and put an encyclopedia first. The first publicly available des-
cription of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the
Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising
the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag,
these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized
Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements
still exist in HTML 4. HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret
and compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages. Default
characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these
characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use
of CSS. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537
Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting
languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the
CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were
derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the
SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes)
rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has been
progressively moved in this direction with CSS. Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application
of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the
mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup
Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document
type definition to define the grammar. The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its
acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the
IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Inter-
net-Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already
 -implemented features like tables and fill-out forms. After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired
in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in 1995 completed "HTML 2.0", the
first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations
should be based. Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests.
Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors,
by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). However, in 2000, HTML also became an international
standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000).

HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004,
development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which
became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.
