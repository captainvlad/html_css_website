            CSS has various levels and profiles. Each level of CSS builds upon the last, typically adding new features and typically denoted as CSS 1,
            CSS 2, CSS 3, and CSS 4. Profiles are typically a subset of one or more levels of CSS built for a particular device or user interface.
            Currently there are profiles for mobile devices, printers, and television sets. Profiles should not be confused with media types, which
            were added in CSS 2.

            <b>CSS 1</b>

            The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation is CSS level 1, published on December 17, 1996. Håkon Wium Lie and
            Bert Bos are credited as the original developers. Among its capabilities are support for:
                            - Font properties such as typeface and emphasis
                            - Color of text, backgrounds, and other elements
                            - Text attributes such as spacing between words, letters, and lines of text
                            - Alignment of text, images, tables and other elements
                            - Margin, border, padding, and positioning for most elements
                            - Unique identification and generic classification of groups of attributes
                            - The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 1 Recommendation.

            <b>CSS 2</b>

            CSS level 2 specification was developed by the W3C and published as a recommendation in May
            1998. A superset of CSS 1, CSS 2 includes a number of new capabilities like absolute,
            relative, and fixed positioning of elements and z-index, the concept of media types,
            support for aural style sheets (which were later replaced by the CSS 3 speech modules) and
            bidirectional text, and new font properties such as shadows.
            The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 2 recommendation.</pre>

            <b>CSS 2.1</b>

            CSS level 2 revision 1, often referred to as "CSS 2.1", fixes errors in CSS 2, removes
            poorly supported or not fully interoperable features and adds already implemented browser
            extensions to the specification. To comply with the W3C Process for standardizing technical
            specifications, CSS 2.1 went back and forth between Working Draft status and Candidate
            Recommendation status for many years. CSS 2.1 first became a Candidate Recommendation on
            February 25, 2004, but it was reverted to a Working Draft on June 13, 2005
            for further review. It returned to Candidate Recommendation on 19 July 2007 and then updated
            twice in 2009. However, because changes and clarifications were made, it again went back to
            Last Call Working Draft on 7 December 2010. CSS 2.1 went to Proposed Recommendation on
            12 April 2011. After being reviewed by the W3C Advisory Committee, it was finally published
            as a W3C Recommendation on 7 June 2011. CSS 2.1 was planned as the first and final revision
            of level 2—but low priority work on CSS 2.2 began in 2015.

            <b>CSS 3</b>

            "CSS3" redirects here. For other uses, see CSS3 (disambiguation).
            Unlike CSS 2, which is a large single specification defining various features, CSS 3 is divided into several
            separate documents called "modules". Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS 2,
            preserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS level 3 started around the time of publication of the original
            CSS 2 recommendation. The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in June 1999. Due to the modularization,
            different modules have different stability and statuses.
