    <b>HTML draft version timeline:</b>
                <b>October 1991</b>
                HTML Tags, an informal CERN document listing 18 HTML tags, was first mentioned in public.
                <b>June 1992</b>
                First informal draft of the HTML DTD, with seven subsequent revisions (July 15, August 6,
                August 18, November 17, November 19, November 20, November 22)
                <b>November 1992</b>
                HTML DTD 1.1 (the first with a version number, based on RCS revisions, which start with
                1.1 rather than 1.0), an informal draft
                <b>June 1993</b>
                Hypertext Markup Language was published by the IETF IIIR Working Group as an Internet
                Draft (a rough proposal for a standard). It was replaced by a
                second version one month later.
                <b>November 1993</b>
                HTML+ was published by the IETF as an Internet Draft and was a competing proposal to
                the Hypertext Markup Language draft. It expired in July 1994.
                <b>November 1994</b>
                First draft (revision 00) of HTML 2.0 published by IETF itself (called as "HTML 2.0"
                from revision 02), that finally led to publication of RFC 1866 in November 1995.
                <b>April 1995 (authored March 1995)</b>
                HTML 3.0 was proposed as a standard to the IETF, but the proposal expired five months
                later (28 September 1995) without further action. It included many of the capa-
                bilities that were in Raggett's HTML+ proposal, such as support for tables, text flow
                around figures and the display of complex mathematical formulas.
                W3C began development of its own Arena browser as a test bed for HTML 3 and Cascading
                Style Sheets, but HTML 3.0 did not succeed for several reasons. The draft was
                considered very large at 150 pages and the pace of browser development, as well as the
                number of interested parties, had outstripped the resources of the IETF. Browser
                vendors, including Microsoft and Netscape at the time, chose to implement different subsets
                of HTML 3's draft features as well as to introduce their own extensions to
                it. (see Browser wars). These included extensions to control stylistic aspects of documents,
                contrary to the "belief [of the academic engineering community] that such
                things as text color, background texture, font size and font face were definitely outside
                the scope of a language when their only intent was to specify how a document
                would be organized."Dave Raggett, who has been a W3C Fellow for many years, has commented
                for example: "To a certain extent, Microsoft built its business on the Web by
                extending HTML features."
                <b>January 2008</b>
                HTML5 was published as a Working Draft by the W3C.
                Although its syntax closely resembles that of SGML, HTML5 has abandoned any attempt to be an
                SGML application and has explicitly defined its own "html" serialization,
                in addition to an alternative XML-based XHTML5 serialization.
                <b>2011 HTML5 – Last Call</b>
                On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones
                for HTML5. In May 2011, the working group advanced HTML5 to "Last
                Call", an invitation to communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of
                the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive test suite to
                achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which was the target date for
                recommendation. In January 2011, the WHATWG renamed its "HTML5"
                living standard to "HTML". The W3C nevertheless continues its project to release HTML5.
                <b>2012 HTML5 – Candidate Recommendation</b>
                In July 2012, WHATWG and W3C decided on a degree of separation. W3C will continue the HTML5
                specification work, focusing on a single definitive standard, which is
                considered as a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization will continue its work with HTML5 as
                a "Living Standard". The concept of a living standard is that it
                is never complete and is always being updated and improved. New features can be added but functionality
                will not be removed. In December 2012, W3C designated HTML5 as a Candidate Recommendation. The criterion
                for advancement to W3C Recommendation is "two 100% complete and fully
                interoperable implementations".
                <b>2014 HTML5 – Proposed Recommendation and Recommendation</b>
                In September 2014, W3C moved HTML5 to Proposed Recommendation.
                On <b>28 October 2014</b>, HTML5 was released as a stable W3C Recommendation, meaning the specification
                process is complete.
                <b>XHTML versions</b>
                XHTML is a separate language that began as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 using XML 1.0. It is no longer
                being developed as a separate standard. XHTML 1.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation on January 26,
                2000, and was later revised and republished on August 1, 2002. It offers the same three variations as
                HTML 4.0 and 4.01, reformulated in XML, with minor restrictions. XHTML 1.1 was published as a W3C
                Recommendation on May 31, 2001. It is based on XHTML 1.0 Strict,
                but includes minor changes, can be customized, and is reformulated using modules in the W3C
                recommendation "Modularization of XHTML", which was published on
                April 10, 2001. XHTML 2.0 was a working draft, work on it was abandoned in 2009 in favor of work on
                HTML5 and XHTML5. XHTML 2.0 was incompatible with XHTML 1.x
                and, therefore, would be more accurately characterized as an XHTML-inspired new language than an
                update to XHTML 1.x. An XHTML syntax, known as "XHTML5.1", is being defined alongside HTML5 in the HTML5
                draft.
